# Toolchain?
- A toolchain is a set of tools (compiler, linker and run-time libraries) that compiles source code into an executables that can run on your target device

- A toolchain should support the language that you require and have a solid implementation of POSIX.  

- A standard gnu toolchain consists of: 
        - Binutils : binary utilities, including the assembler and the linker. 
        - GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) : compilers for C,C++,JAVA.. 
        - C library : the priciple interface to the operating system kernel from applications.
  

### Types of toolchain 

- **Native :** This toolchain runs on the same type of system.  

- **Cross :** This toolchain runs on different type of system, development on pc and testing on an embedded target. 

## CPU architectures

- The toolchain should be built according to the capabilities of the target CPU, which includes:   
        - **CPU architectiure**   
        - **Big or little-endian operation :** Some machines can operate in both modes, but the machine code is different dfor each.   
        - **Floating point support :** Not all processors implement a hardware floating point unit, so the toolchain can be configured to call a software floating point library instead.  
        - **Application Binary Interface :** defines how functions, data structures, and system calls are accessed and represented in binary format.  

- you can print the target triplet for which the GCC compiler is configured. This triplet typically includes the architecture, vendor, and operating system.
```sh
$ gcc -dumpmachine

x86_64-linux-gnu
```
## Chosing the C library 
- The programming interface to the Unix operating system is defined in the C language.

## C libraries: 
- **glibc**: The standard GNU C library 
- **eglibc**: This is the embedded GLIBC 
- **ÂµClibc**
- **musl libc**


## Building a toolchain using Crosstool-NG 

- **Crosstool-NG allows you to see the process of creating the toolchain.

- Before you can Build a toolchain, you need first a working native toolchain and build tools on your host PC.

- The linux `tar` stands for tape archive, used to create and extract archive files.

```sh
tar [options] [archive-file] [file or directory to be archived]
```

- An archieve file is a file that is compressed of one or more files along with metadata, for easier portability and storage.  

- `-c` : Creating a new archieve.  
- `-x` : Extract files from archieve.  
- `-v` : Displaying verbose output, showing the progress of the archiving/extraction process.
- `-f` : Specifying the filename.

- Note that tar is for archiving files (combines multiple files and directories into one archive file) and not compressing files. Instead, you can use a combination of tar and gzip (compression tool) or zip (combined archiving and compression tool).

## Selecting the toolchain 

- Crosstool-NG can build many different combinations of toolchains, it comes with a set of samples that cover many of the common use-cases.

- Use `./ct-ng list-samples`to generate this list.

- You can see the default configuration of a specific architecture by typing :

```sh
$ ./ct-ng show-arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi
[L...]   arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi
    Languages       : C,C++
    OS              : linux-6.4
    Binutils        : binutils-2.40
    Compiler        : gcc-13.2.0
    C library       : glibc-2.38
    Debug tools     : duma-2_5_21 gdb-13.2 ltrace-0.7.3 strace-6.4
    Companion libs  : expat-2.5.0 gettext-0.21 gmp-6.2.1 isl-0.26 libelf-0.8.13 libiconv-1.16 mpc-1.2.1 mpfr-4.2.1 ncurses-6.4 zlib-1.2.13 zstd-1.5.5
    Companion tools :
``` 
- To select this as target configuration you can type
```
$ ./ct-ng arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi
```
- At this point, you can review the configuration and make changes using :
```
$ ./ct-ng manuconfig
```
- Its recommended to change these configurations :
          - In **Path and misc** options, desable **Render the toolchain read-only**, it allows modifications to files in the toolchain directory.
          - In **target options | floating point**,  select **hardware (FPU)**, it specifies that the toolchain should use hardware floating point operations instead of software-based floating point operations in order to improve performance.
          - In **C-library | extra config**, add **--enable-obsolete-rpc**, it ensures that the toolchain's C library can handle legacy RPC calls
   
- The configuration data is saved into a file named .config

- ABI stands for **Application binary interface**, defines how components of binary code, such as libraries, programs interact at the binary level.

- ARM architecture uses different ABIs for floatinh point operations :
          - One uses integer registers for floating point parameters
          - Another uses VFP  (vector floating point)
