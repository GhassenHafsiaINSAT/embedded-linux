# Top Embedded Systems interview questions 
## What is an embedded system?
- It is a hardware system that software designed a perform a specific specialized function or task.
## What are the components of an embedded system? 
- Hardware
- Software
- Operating system
## What are the 5 characteristics of Embedded System?
- It usually performs a single specialized function repeatedly.
- All computing systems on embeded systems have tight constraints.
- The embedded systems on react to the system's environment changes and bring quick results (**REAL-TIME**).
- It must be based on a microcontroller or a microprocessor.  
## What is the startup code?
- It is a code that is called before the execution of the main function.
- It creates a platform for an application to run.
- It is called an **assembly language**.
## What is the Semaphore?
